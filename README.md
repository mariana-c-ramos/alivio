# Alivio | Landing Page with HTML and Sass/CSS
## Overview

This was a simple project to train my skills and knowledge in HTML and CSS.
The main goal is to increase complexity and add more dynamics to the project with each version, finalizing with a full project with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### What I learned

This project was really important to understand 2 key concepts: when to use Grid vs Flexbox and the natural responsiveness of projects. 
I understood that I was over complicating my sass file by defining fixed widths and heights for example - this was breaking the flow of my elements.
I tried to play around a bit with media queries, with tablet mode, both portrait and landscaspe fully done. Still finishing the mobile one.
With this project I also understood the importance of going mobile-first and how media queries get so much easier in that order - will do that in the next projects.

### Useful resources

- [Grid vs Flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3elGSZSWTbM&t=1015s) - This helped me making the layout of the page better, while using flexbox in more appropriate elements.
- [CSS Variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtRmIp4eMjs) - In this video I reviewd again how can variables help with future changes.
- [calc() Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVKwluRTfo&t=123s) - Helped me in creating more dynamic and self-adaptable sizes in paddings and margins,
